        I am an economist by training, consultant by trade, and a technology enthusiast at heart. Born and raised in Nepal, I came to the United States in 2018 to study at Dartmouth College, where I majored in Economics. My journey from the remote Far-Western region of Nepal to the Ivy League shaped my perspective on the transformative power of opportunity and education. After graduating in 2023, I worked as a management consultant at Roland Berger, focusing on healthcare and chemical industry projects.

        Currently, I lead Product, Strategy and Growth at DevDash Labs. I spearhead our pivot to becoming an AI solutions provider, developing products that enhance operational efficiency for clients across multiple states. In the process, I learned to code and sell.

        My experiences span from managing oxygen supply during COVID-19 in Nepal to evaluating multi-billion dollar M&A deals in Boston. These diverse challenges have taught me adaptability and resilience. Beyond work, Iâ€™m a part-time DJ, philosophy enthusiast, and rock climber. I believe in thinking long-term, valuing knowledge over money, and daring to be different. My mission is to leverage technology and economics to drive sustainable development, particularly in emerging markets.
