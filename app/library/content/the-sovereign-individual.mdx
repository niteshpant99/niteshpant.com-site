title: "The Sovereign Individual"
---

Written in 1997, this book predicted cryptocurrency, remote work, and the decline of nation-state power with eerie accuracy. It's not a perfect book—some predictions missed badly—but the framework for thinking about how technology transforms power is invaluable.

## Core Thesis

The nation-state was an artifact of industrial-age economics. When wealth was physical (factories, land, resources), governments could tax it and citizens needed government protection. The information age changes this calculus fundamentally.

Digital wealth is portable. Knowledge workers can live anywhere. Encryption enables privacy. The "cognitive elite" will increasingly opt out of high-tax jurisdictions, becoming "sovereign individuals" who negotiate with governments rather than submit to them.

## What They Got Right

**Remote work and the "cognitive elite"**: The authors predicted that information workers would become location-independent, leading to jurisdictional arbitrage. This seemed fringe in 1997. By 2020, it was obvious.

**Digital money and decentralization**: They foresaw "cybercurrency" that would enable transactions outside government control. Bitcoin launched 11 years later.

**Decline in national loyalty**: They predicted people would identify less with nations and more with global networks of like-minded individuals. Social media tribalism, for better or worse, bears this out.

## What They Got Wrong

The timeline was optimistic. They expected these changes by 2020. We're still in the early stages. Nation-states have proven more resilient than predicted.

They also underestimated network effects and the concentration of power in tech companies. The new gatekeepers aren't governments—they're platforms.

## Why It Matters Now

For anyone building in crypto, remote work, or digital services, this book provides intellectual scaffolding. The underlying logic—that information technology shifts power from institutions to individuals—remains sound even when specific predictions miss.

It's also a useful counterweight to both techno-optimism and techno-pessimism. Technology doesn't automatically make things better or worse. It shifts power, and power flows to those who understand the new landscape.

## Read It If

You're thinking about where to live, how to structure wealth, or what to build for the next decade. The specific predictions matter less than the framework for thinking about technology and power.
