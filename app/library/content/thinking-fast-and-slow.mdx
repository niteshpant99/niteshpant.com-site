title: "Thinking, Fast and Slow"
---

Daniel Kahneman spent his career studying how humans actually think versus how we think we think. The gap is humbling. This book distills decades of research into a framework that's both scientifically rigorous and practically useful.

## The Two Systems

**System 1** is fast, automatic, emotional. It's the snap judgment, the gut feeling, the recognition of a friend's face. It runs constantly, effortlessly.

**System 2** is slow, deliberate, analytical. It's the conscious effort of solving a math problem or following a complex argument. It's lazy and gets tired.

The key insight: System 1 is running the show far more than we realize. Most of what we think is deliberate reasoning is actually post-hoc rationalization of System 1 decisions.

## Cognitive Biases That Hit Home

**Anchoring**: The first number you see affects all subsequent judgments. Negotiators know this. Pricing strategists know this. Now I know this too, and I see anchoring everywhere.

**Loss Aversion**: Losses hurt roughly twice as much as equivalent gains feel good. This explains so much about human behavior—from why people hold losing investments to why they stay in bad jobs.

**The Planning Fallacy**: We consistently underestimate how long things will take, even when we know we underestimate. I now multiply my time estimates by 1.5-2x and I'm still usually wrong.

## Application to Real Life

This book has made me more humble about my own decision-making. When I catch myself with a strong opinion, I now ask: is this System 1 jumping to conclusions? What would System 2 say if I gave it time?

It's also changed how I present information to others. The order matters. The framing matters. The default option matters. These aren't manipulations—they're just how human cognition works.

## The Verdict

Dense in places, but every chapter delivers insights that stick. I've returned to specific sections multiple times. Essential reading for anyone making decisions under uncertainty—which is everyone.
