title: "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant"
---

This isn't a book Naval wrote—it's a collection of his tweets, podcast appearances, and essays compiled by Eric Jorgenson. Somehow, it works better than a traditional book. Naval's ideas are compressed enough that each paragraph could be expanded into a chapter.

## On Wealth

The most important distinction Naval makes: there's a difference between getting rich and getting wealthy. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. You can get rich through luck or working hard—but wealth requires leverage.

**The four types of leverage:**
1. Labor (oldest, least scalable)
2. Capital (requires permission)
3. Media (permissionless, scalable)
4. Code (permissionless, infinitely scalable)

The game has changed. You no longer need employees or investors to build something valuable. Media and code are permissionless leverage available to anyone willing to create.

## On Specific Knowledge

"Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now."

This reframes career advice completely. Instead of asking "what's in demand?", ask "what am I genuinely curious about that can be valuable to others?" The intersection is your edge.

## On Happiness

Naval treats happiness as a skill that can be developed, not a circumstance you achieve. Key practices:
- Desire is suffering. Every desire is an acknowledgment that you're not okay right now.
- The mind is a single-player game. You're playing against yourself.
- Meditation isn't about emptying your mind—it's about observing it.

The wealth stuff gets the attention, but the happiness material has been more practically useful.

## Quotable Lines

> "Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep."

> "Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."

> "The way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic."

## The Verdict

Dense with insight. I keep a copy on my desk and flip through it when stuck. Not everything resonates—some takes are contrarian for the sake of it—but the hit rate is high enough that it's worth wrestling with the rest.

Best consumed slowly, one section at a time, with space to think between readings.
