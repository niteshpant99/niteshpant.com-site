title: "Sapiens"

Harari takes you on a journey through 70,000 years of human history with the clarity of someone explaining it over coffee. The book's central thesis is profound: our species' success comes not from individual superiority, but from our unique ability to believe in shared fictions—nations, money, religions, corporations.

## Key Takeaways

**The Cognitive Revolution** changed everything. Around 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens developed the ability to discuss things that don't physically exist. This ability to create and believe in shared myths allowed us to cooperate in large numbers—something no other species can do.

**The Agricultural Revolution** was, as Harari controversially argues, "history's biggest fraud." We didn't domesticate wheat; wheat domesticated us. Our ancestors worked harder for a worse diet and more disease. But it did allow population growth.

**Money is the most successful story ever told.** Everyone believes in it, even people who believe in nothing else. The dollar has value because we all agree it does—pure collective imagination.

## What Stuck With Me

The idea that **fiction enables cooperation** has changed how I think about organizations, countries, and even my own work. Every company is essentially a shared belief system. The org chart, the mission statement, the equity—all legal fictions that exist because we collectively agree they do.

I also can't stop thinking about the happiness question: did all this "progress" actually make us happier? A forager 30,000 years ago might have had a more meaningful life than a factory worker today. We measure GDP, not fulfillment.

## Who Should Read This

Anyone who wants to zoom out from the daily noise and understand the arc of human civilization. It's especially valuable for founders and builders—understanding the power of narrative and belief systems is crucial for anyone trying to create something new.

**Rating justification:** 5 stars because it fundamentally changed how I see the world. Not because it's perfect or because I agree with everything.
