title: "Man's Search for Meaning"
---

Viktor Frankl survived Auschwitz. This book is partly a memoir of that experience and partly an introduction to logotherapy—his approach to psychotherapy based on finding meaning in life.

I expected the Holocaust sections to be the most impactful. Instead, it was Frankl's observations about human psychology under extreme conditions that stayed with me.

## The Core Insight

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

Even in the camps, prisoners who maintained a sense of purpose survived longer. Not always physically—sometimes they simply died with more dignity. But often, having something to live for made the difference.

## Three Sources of Meaning

Frankl identifies three ways humans find meaning:

1. **Creating work or doing a deed** — contribution, achievement, building something
2. **Experiencing something or encountering someone** — love, beauty, truth
3. **The attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering** — transcendence through how we face what we cannot change

The third one is radical. Suffering isn't meaningful in itself, but our response to it can be. This isn't toxic positivity—it's agency in the face of things we can't control.

## What Changes After Reading This

Small complaints feel embarrassing. Not because suffering is a competition, but because Frankl's framework makes clear how much choice we have in our response to circumstances.

The book also shifted how I think about motivation. We don't need to eliminate suffering or maximize pleasure. We need something to live for. Purpose is more sustaining than comfort.

## On Modern Relevance

Written in 1946, it speaks directly to the "existential vacuum" Frankl saw emerging in modern society. Freed from survival-level concerns, we often lack meaningful goals. The result is what he calls "Sunday neurosis"—the emptiness that descends when the busy week ends.

This predates social media, remote work, and the attention economy. If anything, the vacuum has grown.

## Who Should Read This

Everyone, eventually. But especially anyone going through difficulty, questioning their direction, or feeling that material success hasn't delivered the satisfaction they expected.

It's short enough to read in a sitting. Deep enough to return to for years.
