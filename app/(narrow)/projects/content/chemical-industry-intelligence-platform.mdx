## Revolutionizing Chemical Industry Analysis

In partnership with a prestigious global management consulting firm, DevDash Labs developed Alkemyâ€”a real-time chemical asset monitoring and cost curve automation system that represents the next generation of strategic advisory tools for the chemical industry.

### The Strategic Challenge

Traditional chemical industry analysis relies heavily on static Excel-based models that require weeks to update and lack real-time market integration. This approach creates significant delays in strategic decision-making and limits the ability to respond quickly to market changes in an increasingly dynamic global chemical market.

### Platform Innovation

**Real-Time Market Integration**
Alkemy integrates live commodity pricing APIs to provide up-to-the-minute market data, eliminating the lag time that characterizes traditional analysis methods. This real-time foundation enables dynamic decision-making based on current market conditions.

The platform automates complex production economics modeling that traditionally required extensive manual calculation. By systematizing these analyses, Alkemy enables rapid assessment of production scenarios and profitability under various market conditions.

**Dynamic Cost Curve Generation**
What previously took weeks of manual Excel work now happens in minutes. Alkemy generates comprehensive cost curves automatically, enabling consultants to focus on strategic insights rather than data manipulation.

**Chemical Asset Modeling**
The platform can model virtually any chemical asset worldwide based on technology used and raw material inputs, providing unprecedented flexibility for strategic analysis across diverse chemical operations.
