**Normalized Organizational Context-as-a-Package**

> "No scattered docs. No inconsistent AI. No cap."

nocaap is a developer-first CLI tool that standardizes how AI agents (Cursor, Copilot, Claude) discover and consume organizational knowledge. It uses a Hub-and-Spoke Git architecture to fetch documentation from various repositories into a unified, AI-optimized local index.

Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/niteshpant99/nocaap).

## The Problem

Your AI coding assistant is only as good as its context.

Your Security SOPs are in one repo, Design Tokens in another, and API specs in a third. Your AI is guessing.

nocaap creates a standardized `.context/` folder in your project, populated with the exact versions of the documents your team needs.

## Key Features

### Hub-and-Spoke Discovery
One "Registry" file maps your entire organization's knowledge. Users just select "Engineering" or "Finance" from a menu.

### Native Git Security
We don't handle tokens. If you have SSH access to the repo via GitHub/GitLab, it works. If you don't, it skips. Zero configuration.

### Lightning Fast
Uses `git sparse-checkout` and `partial clones` to fetch *only* the specific documentation folders you need, not the entire repo history.

### AI Optimized
Auto-generates a token-conscious `INDEX.md` that guides AI agents to the right files without blowing up context windows.

### Private Repo Support
Seamlessly handles private repositories using your existing SSH keys - no tokens to manage.

## Installation

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub
npm install -g git+https://github.com/niteshpant99/nocaap.git

# Or with SSH
npm install -g git+ssh://git@github.com:niteshpant99/nocaap.git

# Or run without installing
npx github:niteshpant99/nocaap setup
```

## Usage

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)
```bash
nocaap setup
```
Connects to your organization's registry and lets you interactively select contexts.

### Manual Add
```bash
# Add a full repo
nocaap add git@github.com:your-org/engineering-standards.git

# Add a specific folder (Sparse Checkout)
nocaap add git@github.com:your-org/monorepo.git --path docs/security --alias security-docs
```

### Update & Sync
```bash
nocaap update
```
Checks for updates, verifies file integrity, and regenerates the index.

### Other Commands
```bash
nocaap list      # List installed packages
nocaap remove    # Remove a package
nocaap generate  # Regenerate INDEX.md
```

## Directory Structure

nocaap manages everything inside `.context/`:

```text
project-root/
├── .gitignore            # Should include .context/packages/
├── .context/
│   ├── context.config.json   # Manifest of installed contexts
│   ├── context.lock          # Exact commit SHAs for reproducibility
│   ├── INDEX.md              # THE file you point your AI to
│   └── packages/             # Cloned content (Partial clones)
│       ├── engineering/
│       └── design-system/
```

## AI Integration

To make your AI aware of the context, mention `@.context/INDEX.md` in your prompt, or configure your editor:

**VS Code / Cursor:**
```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.context.additionalContextFiles": [
    ".context/INDEX.md"
  ]
}
```

## Private Repository Support

| Repository Type | How It Works |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Public** | Direct HTTP fetch (fast) |
| **Private** | SSH clone (uses your `~/.ssh` keys) |

No tokens to manage, no credentials to store - true "Zero Auth" design.

## Setting Up Your Organization's Context Hub

Want to create your own context registry? Use the official starter template:

**[nocaap-context-template](https://github.com/niteshpant99/nocaap-context-template)**

1. Fork the template
2. Add your organization's documentation
3. Push - the registry auto-updates via GitHub Actions

Your team can then point nocaap to your new registry and start using it immediately.

## Why nocaap?

The name stands for "Normalized Organizational Context-as-a-Package" - treating organizational context as a versioned, shareable package that AI tools can consume.

Teams don't have to keep copy-pasting the same internal information into agents like Claude or Cursor. Define your organizational identity, past projects, and delivery practices once, and reuse that context across all AI workflows.
