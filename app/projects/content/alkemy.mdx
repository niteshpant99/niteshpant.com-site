The first AI purpose-built for consulting firms. Never rebuild what you've already built.

## The Problem

Nitesh spent a year at Roland Berger. Every project started the same way: hunting through SharePoint for slides he *knew* existed. Sometimes he'd find them after 2 hours. More often, he'd give up and rebuild from scratch.

This isn't a Roland Berger problem. It's an industry problem.

- **25% of analyst time** is spent hunting old slides
- **30% of consulting work** is reusable, but unfindable
- When senior people leave, their knowledge leaves with them
- Boutique firms are sitting on 10-20 years of IP they can't leverage

McKinsey solved this internally with Lilli. BCG built Deckster. But the 50,000 boutique consulting firms? They're still drowning in SharePoint.

## The Unlock

For the first time, LLMs and VLMs can read slides, understand them, and extract structured meaning economically. A 100-slide deck that cost $500 in human time to catalog now costs $0.50 in API calls.

That's a **1000x cost reduction**.

This unlocks a new category: AI-native knowledge infrastructure for consulting.

## The Solution

alkemy is the first AI purpose-built for consulting firms.

We start with **M&A company research**—a painful, manual process that costs firms $5K per project. Our tool does it for $0.50 per company (40x cheaper). This gets us in the door without touching confidential data.

Once we've proven value and earned trust, we expand to **catalog their entire project history**. Every slide, model, framework, and analysis—tagged, indexed, and instantly queryable.

The end state: alkemy becomes the **knowledge layer that powers everything**. AI assistants, research agents, presentation builders—all drawing from the same institutional memory.

## The Wedge → Expand → Platform Motion

| Phase | Focus | Value |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Wedge (Now)** | M&A Research Tool | No confidential data, $0.50/company, immediate ROI |
| **Expand (6-12 months)** | Knowledge Catalog | Catalog all past projects, semantic search, 30 seconds vs hours |
| **Platform (18+ months)** | Consulting Intelligence Layer | Context layer for all AI tools, agents use your IP |

## Core Capabilities

### Company Research & Qualification
Buy-side and sell-side M&A research. Analyze and qualify companies against given criteria. Additional attributes stored in structured formats, rendered beautifully in the UI.

### Project Context
Dump any project files—client data, firm data, meetings, research—and alkemy turns them into structured, searchable knowledge. Each file gets relationships, semantic layers, and becomes instantly queryable. A much better version of NotebookLM.

### Deep Research
Why alkemy's deep research is different:
1. **Customized priorities** - Tell the agent what matters most
2. **Context-aware** - Uses your project context to guide research goals
3. **Persistent data** - All scraped data is stored and accessible to future agents

### Knowledge Management
- Ingest SharePoint and create relationships between project data
- For each slide, Excel, or PDF: build a semantic layer (action-title, subtitle, body, project, tags, dates, clients, industry)
- GraphRAG everything a firm has

## The Moat

Once 10,000 slides are cataloged in alkemy, you can't leave. We become infrastructure. The switching cost is re-cataloging 20 years of work.

Plus: **Data network effects.** Every firm we catalog improves our extraction for the next. We learn consulting vocabulary, methodology patterns, deliverable structures.

## What We Understand That Others Don't

> "Consulting is vertical/industry focused. Clients trust firms in specific domains → more projects in that domain → similar projects → 30% of work is reusable. 25% of analyst time is hunting old slides. Knowledge lives in PM/Partner minds. The bigger and more niche the firm, the more reusable IP they have."

This is our edge. We understand the *structure* of consulting knowledge. Glean sees "files." Harvey sees "documents." We see *project DNA*.

## Competitive Landscape

| Company | Vertical | Wedge | End State |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Hebbia | Finance/Legal | Doc Q&A via Matrix | AI Analyst |
| Rogo | Investment Banking | Research automation | Full research platform |
| o11 | Mid-market PE/M&A | Excel/PPT plugins | Deal execution OS |
| OffDeal | SMB M&A | Deal sourcing | AI investment bank |
| Glean | Generic enterprise | Search | Enterprise search |
| **alkemy** | **Consulting** | **M&A research** | **Consulting intelligence layer** |

## Key Differentiators

1. **Purpose-built for consulting** - Not generic enterprise search
2. **Understands project structure** - Verticals, methodologies, deliverable types
3. **Security-first** - Single-tenant, VPC, on-prem options
4. **Wedge strategy** - Start with M&A (no confidential data), expand to catalog

## The Vision

alkemy is an operating system built for consulting firms. A platform where all client, firm, and project data lives securely, is accessible to AI agents, and creates a rewarding experience to work on.

In the long term, this replaces everything a consultant needs: slides, docs, worksheets, browsers, data storage, research, AI access.

The big problem we're solving: very smart people are wasting time doing very dumb things in consulting. Imagine all the Ivy League talent that could be solving real-world problems instead of hunting for slides. That's the problem alkemy exists to solve.
