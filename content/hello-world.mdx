# HelloWorld

## First Blog
I have always wanted to create a full-stack website. This has been a dream since 2017. Creating websites from stract felt so daunting. Now, life has given me an opportunityt to pivot, and I am going all in. AI is chaning the way we work. I've been immenesly grateful for AI as it has allowed me to learn at a rapid pace. This website, although from a template, came after me building some 3 web apps using AI. 

## Why I write

I confess - I don’t write enough. There is a beauty in writing. Expressing ideas in a clear manner such that anyone can understand them, including oneself. Since I’ve joined DevDash, I’ve had too many ideas. Too many products to build, too many new tools and agents to experiment with, too many cool people to talk to. 

Dear blog reader, 
I will write more.

Why do I like to write - this is a world of writes and write nots; writing is an expression; it’s an art, its an outlet. Plus I’m normally very introverted - this is me speaking and socializing, if you will.
Why I hate LinkedIn writing - too much marketing fluff - from people telling how getting divorced taught them about sales to all bs - a legit Reddit out there

Where can you read? Here.

Until next time friends :)
