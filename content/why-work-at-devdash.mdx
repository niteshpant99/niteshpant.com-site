## दामी काम गरौं

What does it take to build the future of AI? Passion, curiosity, and a relentless drive to create something extraordinary. 

[DevDash Labs](https://devdashlabs.com) is a global AI research and development company. We are a global team of Nepali-origin researchers, developers, strategists, designers, and creators who share a passion for enabling AI adoption. Our mission is to make AI accessible, practical, and impactful for businesses of all sizes. We strive by our unofficial motto - दामी काम गरौं । "गरौं" because we work as a team. We strive for excellence together. DevDash Labs aims to be the best-in-class, global AI research and development company. We are a global team of Nepali-origin researchers, developers, strategists, designers, and creators who share a passion for enabling AI adoption. Our mission is to make AI accessible, practical, and impactful for businesses of all sizes. We strive by our unofficial motto - दामी काम गरौं । "गरौं" because we work as a team. We strive for excellence together. 

This commitment to excellence defines what it means to work at DevDash. Whether you're here for a short internship, or here as a full-time employee, I want you to do great work. Create impact every day. Strive to learn, push your boundaries, and do the best work you've done so far. This doesn't mean working insane hours. I'm a big believer that just because the co-founder works insane hours doesn't mean that every employee should as well. Such a mentality is unhealthy in the long term and leads to employee burnout. Instead, doing great work is loving what you do; it is to pursue something with passion, curiosity, and ambition, driven by a deep interest in the subject and the desire to push one's boundaries.

No wonder everyone who works at DevDash has a burning passion for AI, technology, and innovation. We strive to build great products, both for ourselves and our clients. Great work often requires focused effort, but it’s fueled by intrinsic motivation–love for what you do–rather than external pressures. Doing great work entails creating amazing products that people love. At DevDash, we care deeply about good design. There is no reason to build something if it doesn’t look good, feel good, or work well. Mediocrity is not an option. Perfection is the ideal. While perfection cannot be achieved on our first try, we can iteratively lead ourselves to perfection. This is our design ethos - work consistently towards an ideal product that works, looks, and feels good for its users, iterating along the way.

We value integrity and trust each other to give our best. We are a remote-first company. We take initiative and ownership of our work. Some days are shorter, some are longer. Some are easier, some are harder. Some are quick, and yet some seem to stretch space-time. Every team member is transparent in the work they do and strives to do amazing work. When we’re not working on client projects, we are experimenting with new AI technology; we produce approximately one PoC per week. We have a team-wide demo every Friday. Just because we work fast doesn’t mean we lower our standards. 

At DevDash, we use AI tools to transform how we work. Our guiding principle is clear: embrace automation, minimize manual work, and maximize impact. This approach allows us to focus on what truly matters - delivering real-world solutions. Success is measured through shipped products. When we make commitments—to each other, to our projects, or to our vision—we stand by them. This isn't just about meeting deadlines; it's about supporting each other's growth, maintaining transparency in our work, and collectively pushing toward excellence.

DevDash is but a small lab, yet there are those who love it. If you’re someone who thrives on challenges, loves to learn, and is passionate about AI, DevDash is the place for you. Come join us. We’d love to hear from you.
