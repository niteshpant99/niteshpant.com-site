## What is DevDash?
DevDash Labs is [an AI research and development](https://devdashlabs.com/about) company with three wings - research, product and services. DevDash Labs is the evoluion of DevDash Solutions LLC, a company project we started in 2020. During June 2024 to December 2024, we pivoted, did a complete brand overhaul and morphed into DevDash Labs. 

### Why pivot?
Before I joined, DevDash Solutions was more or less a typical IT outsourcing company. Get one or two clients, create small apps, use Nepali tech labor, arbitage the labor difference. This was, and still is, a very effective model when it comes to IT consulting. However, this isn't scalable. And, in the age of AI agents, I realized that most outsourcing companies would be out of business due to AI agents that can build similar, if not better applications, and much, much faster. I personally have been blessed to learn to code alongside AI. AI (mostly LLMs) have exponentially increased my learning speed. 

So, we faced a dire turth: pivot or become obselete. Pivot.

My co-founder, Tilak, had been tinkering with AI for a few years. He really wanted to go all in on this AI/ML journey. I must admit, during the start of 2024, I was very skeptical of the AI hype. However, I was naive. Perhaps when you're building slides, you don't realize how AI will take over. I remember getting access to an internal AI tool which was very clearly a simple wrapper built around ChatGPT3.5 Turbo and integrated into Teams. Everyone laughed. This was not the revolutionary future that we were promised. Was it? 

But then, life happened. I had no job. I could no longer take DevDash as a side project. Life had given me an opportunity to go all in and pivot, so I did. But, first, we needed to change our branding around DevDash. How could we? 

## Start with the basics
Initially, it is all about getting together a consistent brand image. Who are you? As hard as it is for an individual to answer this question, I must admit that it is significantly harder for organizations to do so. I've had the opportunity to work with other organizational (mini) pivots before, mostly in Nepal. This gave me some confidence to pull through. 

Now, DevDash Solutions LLC would metamorphasize into DevDash Labs. What does this mean? We are now an AI research and development agency. We are focus on developing agents. We are focused on doing research in-house then going about to develop agents.
