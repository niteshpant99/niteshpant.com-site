# My classmates shoult take more risks

I recently read an article by the economist how Ivy League graduates are being taken up by Consulting companies, finance and big tech. My classmates, overwhelming of them I must say, are in this loop. They should take more risks in life. They can do better.

They are intelligent and smart - this is not their differentiator. I think Bezos said this?
