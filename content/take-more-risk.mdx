# My classmates shoult take more risks

I recently read an article by the economist how Ivy League graduates are being taken up by Consulting companies, finance and big tech. My classmates, overwhelming of them I must say, are in this loop. They should take more risks in life. They can do better.

They are intelligent and smart - this is not their differentiator. I think Bezos said this?

So, as I look forward to a life full of risks, I wonder why do my friends not do it? At Dartmouth, there was a certain sense of pride in getting these coveted internships. You are the sum of everyone you hang around. For some reasons, by the time I arrived in Hanover, the trend had long started - everybody wanted to go in corporate America. I must confess that I felt dishearted. I came expecting everyone to be movers and shakers; most turned out to be social climbers.

Social climbing, what a strange topic.
