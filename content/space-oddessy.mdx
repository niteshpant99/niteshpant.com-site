# Venturing into space

## Where will humans be in 25 years from now? Specifically as it relates to space?

There has been a lot of talk and money pouring into commercial space. The price per launch is coming down, and the success rate is going up. Capitalists, naturally, have started exploring avenues of profit from space.

This is such a wild notion in multitudes. Who owns the space? Who gets to profit? If a spaceship crashes into another country, who is to blame? What if the country of origin is a bully, like the US? How do we humans share the space? Do we even have rights to the outer world?

These are questions that I will revisit in due time, but for now, I am pondering hotels in space. Is it possible that in 25 years from now, some space hotel company at the price of billions of dollars puts up a hotel in space, where (very wealthy) tourists can float around? Or maybe there will be artificial gravity, and everyone is enjoying a sip of fine wine looking at the cosmos?

I do not know. But, I ponder.

Humans are very curious. I know this very well because I've been labelled as "extremely curious" by fellow humans, who for some reason can't seem to be excited at the idea of thinking crazy. So curious humans plus resource allocation gives _space_ to inventions. I will not be surprised if I wake up in 25 years to find a company has created plasma rockets.Â 

But what scares me is not us petty humans going into space, but rather the indifference towards equality of the space-faring race (the rich white folks) and of us as a society to stop climate change here on our planet. Looks like we won't act until it is too late. Hopefully, we act...
