## About Me

I'm the co-founder & CEO of [DevDash Labs](https://devdashlabs.com), an applied AI research and development company. We build AI products that solve hard problems—from enterprise chatbots to sales intelligence platforms.

Before DevDash, I was a consultant at Roland Berger and interned at a hedge fund. I studied Economics and Government at Dartmouth College.

I grew up in Dhangadhi, Nepal—a city of 350,000 in the Far Western plains. My family runs education, healthcare, and construction businesses there. During COVID, I went back and helped build one of the first I-beam steel structures in the region. I'm a builder at heart, whether it's software or steel.
