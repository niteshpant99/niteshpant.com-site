# Nitesh Pant portfolio website

Hello world. I am Nitesh, half of the duo behind DevDash Labs. Born and raised in Nepal, educated at Dartmouth, doing AI development at DevDash. 

This website was built using Nextfolio. I modified it just a bit. Thank you to the people behind Nextfolio. 

I updated the OG Nextfolio to be compatible with shadcnui elements. This way, I can make my website even cooler 8)
